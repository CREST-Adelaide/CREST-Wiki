# How the website works

This wiki is a static website, meaning that there is no server-side script running behind the scene to generate the pages upon request. Instead, its HTML, CSS and Javascript files are built and bundled whenever on-demand and deployed on a normal Web server. Thus, static websites such as this wiki requires less resource to run and less complicated technology platform.
